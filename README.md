# Automation
The final project from Automating Real-World Tasks with Python
## The plot:
As an online fruits store developer, I am tasked with developing a system for updating the catalog information with data provided by the suppliers. The suppliers send large images with an associated description of the products in two files (.TIF and .txt). To optimize storage and display, I need to convert the images to smaller jpeg files. Additionally, I must transform the text into an HTML file that shows the image and the product description. To make the catalog information available to customers, I plan to upload the contents of the HTML files to a web service that is already running using Django.

I must gather the name and weight of all fruits from the .txt files and use a Python request to upload this information to the Django server. This request will ensure that the updates can be made in real-time for customers to have the most up-to-date information. Overall, my system will ensure that the catalog information is accurate, visually appealing, and easily accessible to customers.
