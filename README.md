# 🍎 Automation Project  

**Final Project from [Automating Real-World Tasks with Python](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-it-automation)**  

## 🛠️ Project Overview  

This project involves automating the process of updating a fruit catalog for an online fruit store. As the developer, my goal was to build a system that seamlessly handles image and description data provided by suppliers while optimizing storage and making the catalog visually appealing and accessible to customers.

## 📖 The Plot  

As an online fruits store developer, I was tasked with:  

1. **Image Conversion**  
   - Converting large `.TIF` images to optimized `.JPEG` files to save storage space and ensure faster loading times.  

2. **Text Transformation**  
   - Extracting product names and weights from `.txt` files.  
   - Generating an **HTML file** displaying both the product descriptions and their associated images.

3. **Data Upload to Django Server**  
   - Using Python's `requests` module to upload the transformed catalog data to a running Django web service in real-time.  

## ✨ Features  

- 📷 **Image Optimization**  
  Automated `.TIF` to `.JPEG` conversion for efficient storage and faster customer access.  

- 📄 **Dynamic HTML Generation**  
  Transform product descriptions into a visually engaging HTML format that includes images and text.  

- 🌐 **Seamless Integration**  
  Automated catalog updates via Python requests to ensure customers always see the latest product information.  

- 🛡️ **Reliable Automation**  
  Ensures accurate, up-to-date, and visually appealing catalog data.
